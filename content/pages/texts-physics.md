Here I've listed and described my favorite physics texts by topic. See [here](/pages/texts-math) for my favorite maths texts. 
For each of the books listed below, I either own it or have used it in a course. I'll also mark each with a symbol to
indicate the difficulty (I) for introductory, (M) for intermediate, and (A) for advanced.

### Basic Physics
<hr>

##### [Feynman - _The Feynman Lectures_](https://amzn.to/2VGYoQv) (I)

The classic undergraduate three-volume set written by physics' greatest elucidator.

##### [Tipler - _Physics_](https://amzn.to/2H3nJfG) (I)

More modern, all-encompasing volume for introductory physics courses.

##### [Ohanian - _Modern Physics_](https://amzn.to/2JfgnqP) (I)

Common reference for first courses in special relativity.

##### [Taylor - _Introduction to Error Analysis_](https://amzn.to/2Y9kj0t) (I)

Standard introductory reference for experimental methodology, statistical analysis of data, and error propagation.

### Classical Mechanics
<hr>

##### [Taylor -_Classical Mechanics_](https://amzn.to/2DOKHFb) (I)

Great undergraduate reference text, usually seen in an upper-division undergraduate mechanics course. 

##### [Thornton, Marion -  _Classical Dynamics_](https://amzn.to/2VcPYB3) (M)

Undergraduate level classical mechanics text, more advanced than Taylor. 

##### [Goldstein - _Classical Mechanics_](https://amzn.to/2Jh4iRR) (A)

The standard graduate-level text on mechanics.

##### [Arnold - _Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics_](https://amzn.to/2Lnp7hn) (A)

Mathematical tools for classical mechanics. Notation is a bit old (and Russian), for instance $[A, B]$ is used for 
the vector cross product instead of $A \times B$.


<br>

### Electricity & Magnetism
<hr>

##### [Griffiths - _Introduction to Electrodynamics_](https://amzn.to/2LjSvF7) (I)

Standard undergraduate level text on E&M, frequently used for upper-division courses on electricity and magnetism.
Interestingly, doesn't include much on circuits. New edition has a chapter about symmetries and conserved quantities,
a nice introduction to Noethers theorem. 

##### [Jackson - _Classical Electrodynamics_](https://amzn.to/2PO7rdk) (A)

The standard graduate text on E&M, a rite of passage. 

<br>

### Classical Gravity (GR)
<hr>

##### [Carroll - _Spacetime and Geometry_](https://amzn.to/2DN31hL) (I)

Clean, modern reference that is relatively self-contained. Builds the essential differential geometry (quickly) before
introducing gravitational concepts. Notation is very close to modern mathematical literature.

##### [Schutz - _A First Course In General Relativity_](https://amzn.to/2VJ03VM) (I)

Less modern introductory text to GR, worth reading after / with Carroll.

##### [Wald - _General Relativity_](https://amzn.to/2LldLu7) (M)

Standard graduate level introduction to GR. 

##### [Poisson - _Gravity_](https://amzn.to/2Jg7xsX) (M)

Moderately advanced text covering details of Newtonian, Post-Newtonian approximation methods.

##### [Poisson - _A Relativist's Toolkit_](https://amzn.to/2H262gr) (A)

Advanced techniques for applying GR to astrophysical situations, assumes a working knowledge of GR.

##### [Misner, Thornton, Wheeler (MTW) - _Gravitation_](https://amzn.to/2H0Tm9F) (A)

Standard reference text, absolutely massive. Includes the most detail on the most topics out of any book on the subject,
and is a useful reference for practitioners.


<br>

### Numerical Relativity (NR)
<hr>

##### [Baumgarte - _Numerical Relativity_](https://amzn.to/2DNEyci) (M)

Clean, modern introduction to NR, briefly reviews GR but most focus is on numerical considerations. 

##### [Alcubierre - _Introduction to 3 + 1 Numerical Relativity_](https://amzn.to/3A9xbXO) (A)

Standard, in-depth reference on numerical relativity.
