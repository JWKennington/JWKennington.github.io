### Research Interests
My research is primarily focused on classical and quantum gravity. Presently, I am working on 
applications of numerical, semiclassical techniques to loop quantum cosmology. More generally, I am 
interested in analytical and computational approaches within general relativity (GR) and 
loop quantum gravity (LQG), as well as the beautiful, mathematical machinery underlying these theories.  

I aim to apply computational techniques such as tensor network renormalization and coarse 
graining to singularity problems like black hole thermodynamics and early cosmology. Though presently 
focused on theory, I have previously worked on observational problems, including microlensing of 
AGN systems, and continue to be interested in more concrete, astrophysical phenomena, including
gravitational waves.
