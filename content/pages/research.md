My current research interests focus primarily on general relativity and geometry, especially where they
intersect with gravitational waves. I have previously studied non-relativistic astrophysical phenomena 
such as AGN and dark matter clustering, and continue to be interested in the intersection of these phenomena
in the context of relativity.
