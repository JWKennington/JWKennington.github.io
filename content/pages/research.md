### Research Interests
My research is primarily focused on classical and quantum gravity. Presently, I am working on 
applications of numerical, semiclassical techniques to loop quantum cosmology. Also, I'm investigating
computational methods in tensor network renormalization with applications to spinfoams and loop quantum gravity.

More generally, I am interested in analytical and computational approaches within general relativity (GR) and 
quantum gravity (QG), including loop quantum gravity, noncommutative geometry, causal dynamical triangulations, and causal sets. 
I find the beautiful, mathematical machinery underlying these theories equally as intriguing.
