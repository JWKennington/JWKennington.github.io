#### `PyCBC Examples` - Gravitational Wave Data Analysis Examples
The PyCBC library provides excellent tools for loading and analyzing gravitational 
wave data. It also includes some examples (though the are not installed with the package). 
This repo aims to provide an installable set of thorough examples, primarily useful for 
pedagogical purpsoes. This project is open source and may be found on [github](https://github.com/JWKennington/pycbc-examples).


#### `gravtools` - Gravitational Wave Utilities in Python
The gravtools module is a complementary module to the existing, well-written libraries 
pycbc and gwpy. This package began as a few simple utilities, such as constants and date 
conversion helper functions. This project is open source and may be found on [github](https://github.com/JWKennington/gravtools).


#### `apsjournals` - A Python interface to APS publications
The APSJournals project started as an effort to produce an on-demand summary of an entire APS Journal issue, 
and has since been augmented with additional features, such as querying by author. This project is open
source and may be found on [github](https://github.com/JWKennington/apsjournals).


#### `solman` - Solutions Manual utility in Python
Solutions manual writing utility. Though this utility is written in Python, the user is not expected to write 
any python as part of writing solutions. Rather, the solutions are written individually as markdown files (.md) 
in a meaningful directory structure. This package can convert those separate solutions into a variety of outputs, 
including a single LaTeX file as well as Pelican-compatible blog posts / web pages. 
This project is open source and may be found on [github](https://github.com/JWKennington/solman).


#### `julialg` - Julia-style arrays in Python
Small package that wraps numpy n-dimensional arrays and allows for 1-indexed slicing (more mathematically 
intuitive) instead of 0-indexed slicing (computer science convention). Also improves the prettiness of the 
representation of the array in a manner similar to Julia's LinearAlgebra package. To be clear, this is a _Python_
package, meant to bring some of the elegance of Julia's interface for tensors to the Python setting.
This project is open source and may be found on [github](https://github.com/JWKennington/julialg).


#### `pyperbolic` - Hyperbolic geometry in Python
The Pyperbolic project started as a way to produce Poincare disk model diagrams, and is still under
active development. The scope subsequently increased to include some projective and spherical geometry. 
This project is open source and may be found on [github](https://github.com/JWKennington/pyperbolic).
