#### `apsjournals` - A Python interface to APS publications
The APSJournals project started as an effort to produce an on-demand summary of an entire APS Journal issue, 
and has since been augmented with additional features, such as querying by author. This project is open
source and may be found on [github](https://github.com/JWKennington/apsjournals).


#### `pyperbolic` - Hyperbolic geometry in Python
The Pyperbolic project started as a way to produce Poincare disk model diagrams, and is still under
active development. The scope subsequently increased to include some projective and spherical geometry. 
This project is open source and may be found on [github](https://github.com/JWKennington/pyperbolic).


#### `solman` - Solutions Manual utility in Python
Solutions manual writing utility. Though this utility is written in Python, the user is not expected to write 
any python as part of writing solutions. Rather, the solutions are written individually as markdown files (.md) 
in a meaningful directory structure. This package can convert those separate solutions into a variety of outputs, 
including a single LaTeX file as well as Pelican-compatible blog posts / web pages. 
This project is open source and may be found on [github](https://github.com/JWKennington/solman).
