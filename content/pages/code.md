#### `apsjournals` - A Python interface to APS publications
The APSJournals project started as an effort to produce an on-demand summary of an entire APS Journal issue, 
and has since been augmented with additional features, such as querying by author. This project is open
source and may be found on [github](https://github.com/JWKennington/apsjournals).


#### `pyperbolic` - Hyperbolic geometry in Python
The Pyperbolic project started as a way to produce Poincare disk model diagrams, and is still under
active development. The scope subsequently increased to include some projective and spherical geometry. 
This project is open source and may be found on [github](https://github.com/JWKennington/pyperbolic).
