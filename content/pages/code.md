#### `apsjournals` - A Python interface to APS publications
The APSJournals project started as an effort to produce an on-demand summary of an entire APS Journal issue, 
and has since been augmented with additional features, such as querying by author. This project is open
source and may be found on [github](https://github.com/JWKennington/apsjournals).
