I am a quantitative developer, aspiring physicist, and armchair geometer. My research interests include classical and 
quantum gravity, as well as the geometry underlying those theories. I also enjoy studying related phenomena through computation,
such as gravitational waves, black hole dynamics, and tensor networks.

Here you will find some [informal posts](/blog), [my CV](/pages/cv) and [publications](/pages/publications). I've also posted links 
to my open-source software projects on [github](/pages/code). You may contact me 
at [jameswkennington@gmail.com](mailto:jameswkennington@gmail.com).

Away from the key and chalk boards, I spend most of my time hiking, stargazing, and baking sourdough breads.
