I am a Graduate Fellow at Penn State University working in the [Institute for Gravitation and the Cosmos](http://www.gravity.psu.edu/). My research interests include classical and
quantum gravity, as well as the underlying geometry and algebra. I also enjoy studying associated relativistic 
phenomena through computer simulation, such as cosmological structure formation and black hole dynamics.

Here you will find some [informal posts](/blog), [my CV](/pages/cv) and [publications](/pages/publications). I've also posted 
links to my open-source software projects on [github](/pages/code). You may contact me 
at [jwkennington@psu.edu](mailto:jwkennington@psu.edu).

Away from the key and chalk boards, I spend most of my time hiking, stargazing, and baking sourdough breads.
