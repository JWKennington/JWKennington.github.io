quote: We must not forget that all things in the world are connected with one another and depend on one another, and that we ourselves and all our thoughts are also a part of nature. Absolute time has therefore neither a practical nor a scientific value; and no one is justified in saying that he knows aught about it. It is an idle metaphysical conception.

I am the [Mildred Dresselhaus Graduate Fellow](https://science.psu.edu/future-students/graduate-students/science-achievement-graduate-fellowship/2020-2021-recipients/mildred-dresselhaus-graduate-scholarship-in-physics) at Pennsylvania State University working in the [Institute for Gravitation and the Cosmos](http://www.gravity.psu.edu/). My research interests include classical and
quantum gravity, as well as the underlying geometry and algebra. I also enjoy studying associated relativistic phenomena through computer simulation, such as cosmological structure formation and black hole dynamics. More information 
on my research interests may be found [here](/pages/research).

On this site you will also find some [informal posts](/blog), [my CV](/pages/cv) and [publications](/pages/publications). I've also posted 
links to my open-source software projects on [github](/pages/code), as well as a collection of generally-useful [resources](/pages/resources). You may contact me 
at [jwkennington@psu.edu](mailto:jwkennington@psu.edu). Away from the key and chalk boards, I spend most of my time cooking, climbing, and stargazing.
