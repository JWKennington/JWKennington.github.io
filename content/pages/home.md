quote: We must not forget that all things in the world are connected with one another and depend on one another, and that we ourselves and all our thoughts are also a part of nature. Absolute time has therefore neither a practical nor a scientific value; and no one is justified in saying that he knows aught about it. It is an idle metaphysical conception.

I am a [Mildred Dresselhaus Graduate Fellow](https://science.psu.edu/future-students/graduate-students/science-achievement-graduate-fellowship/2020-2021-recipients/mildred-dresselhaus-graduate-scholarship-in-physics) 
at the Pennsylvania State University working in the [Institute for Gravitation and the Cosmos](http://www.gravity.psu.edu/). My research interests include classical and
quantum gravity. Specifically, I focus on gravitational wave source modeling and data analysis. I am a member of the 
[LIGO Scientific Collaboration](https://roster.ligo.org/roster.php?do=member&uid=6316&search=name&target=in&order=) 

I am also interested in spinfoams, causal dynamical triangulations, and noncommutative geometry, with an emphasis on computational methods.
