#### Research Experience
- **2017 - 2018: Zale Lipshy Hospital, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas TX**
    - **_Mathematical Consultant_**, Pain Medicine Lab
    - Provided statistical and programming expertise to various research projects related to the dosing of pain medication. Wrote Python code to model pain medicine response, resulting in publication.
- **2013 - 2015: Center for Nonlinear Dynamics, University of Texas, Austin TX**
    - **_Undergraduate Researcher_**, Raizen Lab
    - Researched brownian motion under various non-Newtonian fluid model assumptions. Assisted with atomic optics experiments, focused on the optical tweezing of micrometer-scale beads to understand short-timescale behavior transition of fluids. Also conducted exploratory work in nanofluid and graphene manipulation.
- **2014 - 2015: Directed Reading Program, University of Texas, Austin TX**
    - **_Undergraduate Researcher_**, Department of Mathematics
    - Researched topics in graduate mathematics with a personal (then) graduate student mentor, Dr. César Garza. Research culminated in two 15-minute, AMS format talks explaining research to undergraduate peers. Topics researched include topology, category theory, smooth manifolds, and dynamical systems.
- **2011 - 2013: Gravitational Microlensing Lab, United States Naval Academy, Annapolis MD**
    - **_Undergraduate Researcher_**, Morgan Lab
    - Researched the structure of quasars and the use of gravitational microlensing as a tool for resolving physical characteristics of active galactic nuclei. Responsible for reducing data and writing scripts to manipulate data obtained from U.S. Naval Observatory. Implemented perl and IRAF solutions resulting in significant error reduction in light-curve data. Supervised by Dr. Christopher Morgan.
- **Fall 2012: United States Naval Observatory, Flagstaff AZ**
    - **_Undergraduate Researcher_**, Kaj-Strand Astrometric Reflector
    - Operated the 1.55-m Kaj Strand astrometric reflector telescope to take infrared images of several quasar systems. Participated in colloquia. Visited Navy Precision Optical Interferometer at Lowell Observatory.
