  abstract = {Searches for known waveforms in gravitational wave detector data are often done using matched filtering. When used on real instrumental data, matched filtering often does not perform as well as might be expected, because nonstationary and non-Gaussian detector noise produces large spurious filter outputs (events). This paper describes a {$\chi$}2 time-frequency test which is one way to discriminate such spurious events from the events that would be produced by genuine signals. The method works well only for broadband signals. The case where the filter-template does not exactly match the signal waveform is also considered, and upper bounds are found for the expected value of {$\chi$}2.},

  abstract = {We study the effect of spins on searches for gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences in realistic simulated early advanced LIGO data. We construct a detection pipeline including matched filtering, signal-based vetoes, a coincidence test between different detectors, and an estimate of the rate of background events. We restrict attention to neutron star-black hole (NS-BH) binary systems, and we compare a search using nonspinning templates to one using templates that include spins aligned with the orbital angular momentum. To run the searches we implement the binary inspiral matched-filter computation in PyCBC, a new software toolkit for gravitational-wave data analysis. We find that the inclusion of aligned-spin effects significantly increases the astrophysical reach of the search. Considering astrophysical NS-BH systems with nonprecessing black hole spins, for dimensionless spin components along the orbital angular momentum uniformly distributed in (-1,1), the sensitive volume of the search with aligned-spin templates is increased by {$\sim$}50\% compared to the nonspinning search; for signals with aligned spins uniformly distributed in the range (0.7,1), the increase in sensitive volume is a factor of {$\sim$}10.},

The search was used in the first Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) observing run and unambiguously identified two black hole binary mergers, GW150914 and GW151226. At its core, the PyCBC search performs a matched-filter search for binary merger signals using a bank of gravitational-wave template waveforms. We provide a complete description of the search pipeline including the steps used to mitigate the effects of noise transients in the data, identify candidate events and measure their statistical significance. The analysis is able to measure false-alarm rates as low as one per million years, required for confident detection of signals. Using data from initial LIGO's sixth science run, we show that the new analysis reduces the background noise in the search, giving a increase in sensitive volume for binary neutron star systems over previous searches.},
