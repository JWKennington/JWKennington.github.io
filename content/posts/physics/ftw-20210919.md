As this is the inaugural issue of the _found-this-week_ series, I'll briefly note my motivation and inspiration. The
title of this series is an overt nod to the famous series [_This Week's Finds_](https://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/TWF.html)
written by the inimitable John Baez. I have learned a great deal from that series and his book on gravity, and have the
utmost admiration for Baez' abilities as a physicist and communicator. It is my hope that this series will be found
useful by some, insightful by at least a few, and accessible by many. All feedback is welcome, and thank you in advance
for bearing with me as I develop these posts.

### Algebraic and Geometric Equivalence of Tangent Vectors

As will likely come up in future posts, I'm thoroughly enjoying
[Modern Differential Geometry for Physicists](https://amzn.to/39jLEEN) by Chris Isham. He develops formalism and
intuition without sacrificing rigor, all while carrying a conversational tone. See my
[reference review](/pages/texts-physics/#isham-modern-differential-geometry-for-physicists-i) for more on
[@ishamModernDifferentialGeometry1999].

Most students of physics or calculus are generally familiar with the notion of a tangent vector. This concept becomes
more nuanced, of course, when the ambient space is generalized from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to a manifold $\mathcal{M}$ of
dimension $n$. Isham takes an unusual approach to formalizing the tangent vector concept by introducing two
seemingly-different definitions (either of which are common among the relativity literature) and then formally proving
their equivalence (done _nowhere_ in the literature). I appreciated the demonstration of equivalence, and will sketch it
below.
