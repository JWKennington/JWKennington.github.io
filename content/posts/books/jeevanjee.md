##### Summary
I picked up a copy of Nadir Jeevnajee's [An Introduction to Tensors and Group Theory for Physicists](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Tensors-Group-Theory-Physicists/dp/3319147935/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=jeevanjee&qid=1551765862&s=gateway&sr=8-3)
a few months ago with the intent of skimming through and spending most of my time in reference texts. To my pleasant
surprise, I found this text to be self contained - requiring little to no references. The presentation is at once mathematically rigorous 
and physically intuitive, alluding to well-known examples from physics throughout.

In the below sections, I will briefly summarize the content presented as well as how this presentation compares to other known
texts in the subject (that I'm aware of!). 

##### Part I: Tensors
The introduction to tensors as multilinear functions 

##### Part II: Group Theory
In progress, check back later for more.

##### Solutions
As I read through the text I'm compiling a solutions manual, which I will post on this site when complete. Until then,
you can access a preliminary manuscript [here]({static}/pdfs/solns/jeevanjee.pdf). I will also continue to update this review
as relevant.
