Austin university in Nacogdoches to discuss recent developments in the field. They weren't alone, though. The meeting was shared between the APS, AAPT, and SPS - so if you were interested in physics research, studying physics, or teaching physics, there was something there that could hold your attention. For me, there were a couple talks related to astrophysics that seemed worth the drive; I hit the road early Friday morning to arrive in time for the first talk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Billy Quarles' talk, &lt;em&gt;Potential for Exoplanetary Neighbors in Alpha Centauri&lt;/em&gt;, included a brief discussion of methodologies used to detect exoplanets. Though Quarles and his collaborators recent work seemed to focus mostly in RV techniques, the discussion on photometric methods was particularly interesting. The way that he presented the problem seemed to lend itself naturally to some geometric tricks that would allow for closed-form solutions to the intensity of the star during an exoplanet transit. I am drafting an analysis of these tricks presently, and will update this post with a link once complete - however the sketch goes something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let an exoplanet of mass &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(m\)&lt;/span&gt; orbit a star of mass &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(M\)&lt;/span&gt; (clearly, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(m &amp;lt; M\)&lt;/span&gt;). The ellipticity of this orbit isn't immediately important, since we're going to make a few simplifying assumptions. First we use &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(T \cup \mathcal{O}(3)\)&lt;/span&gt; invariance of the trajectory geometry to align the orbital plane with the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; - &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt; plane in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{R}^3\)&lt;/span&gt;. We also choose to align the orbital angular momentum &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(L\)&lt;/span&gt; with the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(z\)&lt;/span&gt; axis of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\mathcal{R}^3\)&lt;/span&gt;. Next, we choose a reference point &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; along the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; axis to serve as the "observer". When the observer is sufficiently far from the planetary system, as the Earth is from even our nearest  neighboring system, then we may approximate the path of the light exiting the system as a projection along the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(x\)&lt;/span&gt; axis into the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y\)&lt;/span&gt; - &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(z\)&lt;/span&gt; plane, namely &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\pi_{1}: \mathcal{R}^3 \rightarrow \mathcal{R}^2\)&lt;/span&gt; defined by &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\pi_{1}(x, y, z) = (y, z)\)&lt;/span&gt;. This assumption allows us to reduce the problem of intersecting volumes to one of intersecting areas! The remaining geometric problem can thus be stated: Given two circles &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(S_{p1}^1(r_1)\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(S_{p_2}^1(r_2)\)&lt;/span&gt;, where the centers &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p_1\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p_2\)&lt;/span&gt; are represented as smooth functions of time &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\alpha_1(t)\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\alpha_2(t)\)&lt;/span&gt;, give the intersectional area &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(A_{\cap}(t)\)&lt;/span&gt; as a function of time. The intensity of the star during transit will be proportional to this function to a first order.&lt;/p&gt;

arrives at an unconventional physical assertion: that non-relativistic sound waves carry gravitational mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This claim should sound odd to anyone who has taken an undergraduate mechanics course, as one of the first physical assertions
about waves is that they transport energy &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; matter (which possesses gravitational mass), but not having any
mass of it's own. The original paper focuses on the focused effect of such behavior on condensed matter solids, though
they authors assert the result is more general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we assume their result to be true, then I find the following train of thought interesting. Given a sound wave propagating through
a solid that itself possesses gravitational mass, to what extent do the sound wave and the medium interact gravitationally? Are 
there any circumstances (very "loose" media, such as IGM) under which that interaction would play an important role in the dynamics
of the resulting wave? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the above questions are tempting - I'll wait until Nicolis and Penco either experimentally observe their proposed effect,
or can present a more general version of their initial results. Either way - interesting!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="physics"></category><category term="waves"></category></entry></feed>
