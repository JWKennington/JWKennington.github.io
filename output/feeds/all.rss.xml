arrives at an unconventional physical assertion: that non-relativistic sound waves carry gravitational mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This claim should sound odd to anyone who has taken an undergraduate mechanics course, as one of the first physical assertions
about waves is that they transport energy &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; matter (which possesses gravitational mass), but not having any
mass of it's own. The original paper focuses on the focused effect of such behavior on condensed matter solids, though
they authors assert the result is more general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we assume their result to be true, then I find the following train of thought interesting. Given a sound wave propagating through
a solid that itself possesses gravitational mass, to what extent do the sound wave and the medium interact gravitationally? Are 
there any circumstances (very "loose" media, such as IGM) under which that interaction would play an important role in the dynamics
of the resulting wave? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the above questions are tempting - I'll wait until Nicolis and Penco either experimentally observe their proposed effect,
or can present a more general version of their initial results. Either way - interesting!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">J. W.

&lt;p&gt;I picked up a copy of Nadir Jeevnajee's &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Tensors-Group-Theory-Physicists/dp/3319147935/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=jeevanjee&amp;amp;qid=1551765862&amp;amp;s=gateway&amp;amp;sr=8-3"&gt;An Introduction to Tensors and Group Theory for Physicists&lt;/a&gt;
a few months ago with the intent of skimming through and spending most of my time in reference texts. To my pleasant
surprise, I found this text to be self contained - requiring little to no references. The presentation is at once mathematically rigorous 
and physically intuitive, alluding to well-known examples from physics throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the below sections, I will briefly summarize the content presented as well as how this presentation compares to other known
texts in the subject (that I'm aware of!). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Part I: Tensors&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction to tensors as multilinear functions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Part II: Group Theory&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In progress, check back later for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Solutions&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I read through the text I'm compiling a solutions manual, which I will post on this site when complete. Until then,
you can access a preliminary manuscript &lt;a href="/pdfs/solns/jeevanjee.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I will also continue to update this review
as relevant.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">J. W.
